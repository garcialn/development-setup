# Development Setup Configurations
Configuration and dotfiles for fast and easy development setup of the following tools:
- zsh
- starship
- wezterm
- nvim
- zellij
- tmux
- espanso
- kanata
---
Install `nala`, `zoxide`, `lsd`, `zinit`, `atuin`, `bat` and `stow` for better experience (in my opinion).
After that, use the command `stow */` to create the correct symlinks.
